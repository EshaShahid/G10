The assignment involves designing, implementing, and testing a high-fidelity web app based on a provided case study. Here's a breakdown of the key tasks:


1. Team details and individual contributions:
   Saffa: Team leader and UI/UX Designer A
   Humera: UI/UX Designer B
   Ayza: User Story Writer
   Ayesha: Non-Functional Requirements Writer
   Esha: Frontend and backend Developer A
   Abdullah:Frontend and backend Developer B

This Repository contains following: 

1. A Lo-Fi prototype of the web app (created using draw.io).

2. A zip file with the web app's code, database, and machine learning model notebook.

3. A video showing the web app's features.

4. User Stories: Write four detailed user stories that describe how different stakeholders interact with the web app.

5. Non-Functional Requirements: Define five non-functional requirements such as usability, accessibility, availability, performance, and security.
   
7.  4 browser automation tests for our web app. Introduced and demonstrated the implemented tests in video.

   
Description of each of the above:

1. Low Fidelity Prototype: Design the initial layout and functionality of your web app using draw.io. It should focus on core features, usability, and flow, without finalizing the appearance.

2. Machine Learning Model:

Used Pycharm to train a model to recognize classes in the dataset.

Compare different machine learning algorithms, perform hyper-parameter optimization, and plot results (e.g., confusion matrix).

Web App Development:

Implement the four user stories using Python Flask and SQLite.

Provide evidence of Git/GitHub usage for version control.

Testing:

Create four test cases related to the implemented user stories.

Develop either unit tests or browser automation tests for the web app.

This project emphasizes communication, collaboration, design, implementation, testing, and documentation. The final deliverables include the report, video, prototype, code, machine learning model, and test cases.
